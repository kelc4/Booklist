# My Personal Project

## Book List Application Overview

The application will be a list of books. With this list, the user will be able to add and remove books from the list.
With each book on the list, they will be able to see the title, author, genre, date added to the list, and an image of the cover.
They will also be able to check off the books they've read, add a rating and a note about the book. The list will be
organized by when they add the book to the list however they have the option to display only
the ones with common features they want to see. (Ex. genre = fantasy, author = )

This application is for people like books, likes recommending books and those who always have a long reading list. 
This project is interesting to me because I personally have my own list for those exact purposes.

A *bulleted* list:
- item 1
- item 2
- item 3

An example of text with **bold** and *italic* fonts.  Note that the IntelliJ markdown previewer doesn't seem to render 
the bold and italic fonts correctly but they will appear correctly on GitHub.
