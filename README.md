# My Personal Project

## BookList Application Overview

The application will be a list of books. With this list, the user will be able to add and remove books from the list.
With each book on the list, they will be able to see the title, author, date added to the list, and book number. They 
will also be able to check off the books they've read. The list will be organized by when they added the book to the
list.

This application is for people like books, likes recommending books and those who always have a long reading list. 
This project is interesting to me because I personally have my own list for those exact purposes.

### **User Stories**:
